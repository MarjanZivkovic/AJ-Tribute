                        <h4>Beginnings</h4>
                        <h2>Blog</h2>
                        <p>AJ started publishing his Effortless Acquisition Blog in 2003. He wrote about problems with the traditional education system, his experiences as a teacher, and the results of new methods he was applying in his class. He intended to reach other English teachers.</p>
                        <p>Working as an English teacher AJ realized that traditional school methods suked. The students were bored out of their minds and did not improve at all. As someone who deeply cares about his students, he decided this state was not sustainable and it was time to make some changes.</p>
                        <p>He researched constantly new teaching methods and new ideas. Everything he learns he would apply immediately. He saw what worked and what did not. He made changes, improvised, and created his unique <a href="#ee-method">teaching method</a>. All of this he would publish in his blog which became very popular, especially among students.</p>
                        <p>AJ continued writing the blog until 2009. You can still access it on this webpage <a href="http://effortlessacquisition.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">effortlessacquisition.blogspot.com</a>. You'll embark on a journey of AJ's struggles and frustrations but also hope and enthusiasm, all through well-written blog posts. It's a very good read. Enjoy!</p>

                                <p>Your school uses a "good textbook". So what, everybody does. You do clever pairwork, groupwork, and games. So what, everybody does. You throw in the occasional role play. So what, everyone does. Your school has a whiteboard, neutral colored carpet, white walls, and flourescent lights... just like everyone else.</p> 
                                <p>In the effort to offend no one, we sink into mediocrity. Bureaucrats and teachers often seem terrified of making anyone unhappy. They seem to prefer tepid acceptence to passionate engagement. As a student, I hated this approach.</p>
                                <p>As a teacher, I hate it even more. I am, in fact, bored out of my goddam mind by most schools. Im bored with timidity. Im bored with Oxford/Longman textbooks. Im bored with "meeting standards". Im bored with corporate decor. Im bored with the same old thing.</p>
                                <p>Id much rather try something remarkable. By nature, these kinds of attempts stir strong reactions...</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <article>
                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>The philosophy behind the EE method is <strong>TAOISM</strong>. Taoism is an ancient Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (the Way). At the core of Taoism is a concept called Wu Wei - a state of unconflicting personal harmony, free-flowing spontaneity, inaction, or effortless action.</p>
                    <p>AJ applied these principles to teaching English trying to create a method that will go in harmony with nature not against it. That means learning naturally as babies learn their native language with lots of listening and without forcing to speak. It is about going with the current instead of against it. Therefore the name EFFORTLESS English. Originally AJ planned to call his method Effortless-effort English, which would be a more accurate name because Effortless English is not lazy English, a learner needs to put a lot of hours into it. However, he decided to choose a more simple and effective name.</p>
                    <p>AJ's favorite Taoist philosophers are Lao Tzu and Alan Watts.</p>
                    <div class="tooltip-container"> 
                        <div class="tooltip-heading"><span> AJ on WU WEI:</span> <span class="tooltip-btn"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></span> </div> 
                        <div class="tooltip">
                           <p>The effortless acquisition curriculum attempts to follow the Taoist concept of “wu wei”, which can roughly be translated as “not forcing”, “not strivng”, or “effortless effort”. Wu wei hints at an approach that is akin to going with the grain rather than against it. It is action in accord with nature.</p> 
                           <p>Alan Watts uses the metaphor of piloting a boat to illustrate the difference between wu wei and the standard approach of striving. When piloting a boat, one might choose to row. This is a tried and true means of getting from point A to point B in a boat. It requires a huge expenditure of energy and effort, but eventually it does work. However, the wise pilot will raise a sail instead of rowing. By using the wind, by adjusting his sail to it and tacking when necessary, the sailor goes much farther much faster with much less effort. Without doubt, sailing is a much lazier way of piloting a boat. It is also incredibly more effective and efficient.</p>
                           <p>The metaphor is equally applicable to language teaching. Yes, it is possible to achieve proficiency in a foreign language through grammar-translation, drills, memorizing vocabulary, and analysis. But this is akin to rowing. It requires a tremendous amount of mental effort... </p>

                    <h2>Influences</h2>
                    <p><strong>Dr. Stephen D Krashen</strong> <br>Dr. Stephen Krashen is the leading expert on natural language acquisition research and theory. He's best known for his input hypothesis that emphasizes the primary importance of comprehensible input in learning a language. Krashen puts high importance on the use of free voluntary reading.  </p>
                    <p><strong>Dr. James Asher</strong> <br>Dr. James Asher is the pioneer of a technique called "Total Physical Response"(TPR). TPR  is a method of teaching language or vocabulary concepts by using physical movement to react to verbal input. The teacher performs an action, both demonstrating and saying it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Blaine Ray</strong> <br>Blaine Ray is the creator of Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPRS). TPRS is a fun, stress-free technique. The teacher tells stories and has students act them out physically, playing various roles and characters. Sometimes the story is re-told from a different point of view or using a different time frame.</p>
                    <p><strong>Other researchers / educators</strong><br> Dennis Littky, Dr. Ashley Hastings, John Taylor Gatto, Ramiro Garcia, Valerian Postovsky, Keith Challenger, Dr. J. Marvin Brown, David Long</p>

                    <h2>Creation</h2>
                    <p>As AJ always says, taking action is the most important. He was reading and researching these great concepts but he also took massive action. He kept experimenting in his classroom creating his own teaching method which was to become the ultimate best English learning system. AJ often refers to it as &nbsp; <a href="#ee-engine"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></a></p>

                       <p>Think about something great in your life. Think about the biggest success you have ever had. Think about your future success speaking English powerfully. Smile bigger. First you are just pretending, but eventually you will feel stronger and happier. That's because your emotions change when your body changes. It's a simple technique.</p>
                       <p>Of course, you can feel even better by using your body even more. Instead of just standing and smiling, raise your arms over your head. Then jump in the air like you are celebrating a big victory. And use your voice. Shout and cheer loudly as you jump and smile and think of wonderful things. Go crazy! This is called a “peak emotional state,” an intensely powerful positive emotion.</p>
                       <p>The final step, of course, is to connect this great feeling to English. So, still feeling great, immediately start listening to an easy English audio. As you are listening, continue to smile and move your body in a strong, positive way.</p>

                        <p>"In my opinion, learners are the most important people in education. Not teachers. Not schools. Not administrators and bureaucrats. Not textbook publishing companies. <strong> Learners</strong>!</p>
                        <p>I've also come to realize that language learners are the people I really want to reach- not teachers. Unfortunately, the education industry is broken, and I don't think it can be fixed by teachers. Learners are the ones who will fix education. They will fix it by abandoning traditional language education in favor of independent learning methods that work. They will fix it by creating their own learning communities."</p>

                <h4>Platforms</h4>
                <h2>Social Media</h2>
                <p>Effortless English has always relied on social media as a way of promoting courses but also as a place to build a community of learners. But from the very beginning, AJ was concerned about the censorship of big tech companies. In fact, one of the lessons in the Original course was called Microsoft's Cyber Censorship</p>
                <p>Other than Microsoft, Effortless English has been partially censored by Google (including shadow banning by YouTube), Apple, Facebook, and Twitter. In pursuit of a place where he can freely express his ideas AJ'd been experimenting with lots of different platforms:</p>
                <div class="social-flex">Squidoo BitChute BitTube Instagram Snapchat Reddit Vimeo Periscope Minds One-Way Telegram Steemit Stitcher DTube <strong>Gab</strong></div>
                <h2>Forums</h2>
                <p><strong>Effortless English Club Forum</strong> was the original place for the students to connect. It was hosted on effortlessenglishclub.com. The forum is not active anymore.</p>
                <p><strong>Twitter</strong> For many years Twitter had been the place to connect with AJ and other Effortless English students. Since 2019 AJ is not active on Twitter because of censorship and his account was suspended at times.</p>
                <p><strong>Effortless English Gab Group</strong> is the current official group for Effortless English members and fans. As of this writing, the group has almost 15k members from all over the world.

                <h4>Challenges</h4>
                <p>Challenges are a way to push yourself in order to improve. It's about putting maximum effort over a period of time. Over the years EE family has done many challenges together with AJ.</p>
                <h2>Challenges done, chronologically</h2>
                <p><strong>Walking / Running Challenge</strong> <br> Participants could do either the walking or running challenge or both. They counted kilometers or hours of walking/running.</p>
                <p><strong>EE Strong</strong><br>Participants recorded the number of pushups and pullups they could do at the beginning of the challenge. Then over three months, they put maximum effort to increase that number and get stronger.</p>
                <p><strong>Listening / Reading Challenge</strong><br> Participants could do either the listening or reading challenge or both. They counted hours of listening or reading in English. AJ did his challenge in Japanese.</p>
                <p><strong>Speaking Challenge</strong><br> Participants could do either the conversation or shadowing challenge or both. They counted hours of speaking or shadowing in English. AJ did his challenge in Japanese.</p>
                <p><strong>Weight Loss Challenge</strong><br> Participants recorded their weight in kilograms at the beginning of the challenge. Then over three months, they put maximum effort to decrease their weight. AJ used fasting as his method for this challenge.</p>
                <p><strong>365 Challenge</strong><br>365 challenge was a consistency challenge. Participants needed to do something in English (listening, reading, speaking) for one hour, trying not to skip a day over 365 days. AJ did his challenge with Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
                <p><strong>Conversation Challenge</strong> <small class="in-progress">In Progress</small> <br>Participants recorded their day-0 video speaking English. Then over three months, they are trying to speak as much as possible in English. At the end of the challenge, they'll record another video in which their improvement will be visible (hopefully). AJ's doing his challenge in Japanese. </p>

                            <h3>Effortless English: Learn to speak English like a native by AJ Hoge</h3> 
                            <h4>A book that every language learner and every teacher should get and read.</h4>
                            <p>You could think: “Well, this is just another book about learning a language like numerous others on the market!” And you would be totally right. A lot of books have already been written on that topic, with different approaches, different analysis, different opinions. So why should you read this one? What's so special with AJ's book, is that, with his now famous clear way of communicating, AJ will guide you step by step, through your whole learning process.</p>
                            <p>Based on serious studies and his own teaching experience, he explains us why the traditional methods don't and can't work well. “The problem with schools is, English is not a subject to be studied. English is a skill to be performed or played. Speaking is something you do not something you analyze or think about.”.</p>
                        </div> 
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <div class="review">
                            <p> He then gives us the tools, or the engine as he calls it (The Effortless English Method described in 7 rules). But an engine, even the best one, cannot work efficiently without the proper fuel. That's why AJ insists on the necessity to build a strong psychology and gives you the key to produce the best fuel ever to empower your engine. This strong psychology includes your feelings towards English, your beliefs, your energy and your motivation. Without this fuel, without a powerful psychology, chances are that it will be much harder to reach fluency.</p>
                            <p>While I was reading, a lot of ghosts re-emerged from a long gone past: all those hours sitting in a room at school, the tests, the frustration of not being understood, the struggles to speak, the embarrassment of being corrected or even laughed at - “English trauma”. Fortunately, I learned along the book to weaken these fears and bad emotions, to focus on empowering moments and create a positive energy. Now I can smile at old these old memories.</p>
                            <p>While the core of the book focuses on the seven Effortless English gold rules of learning how to speak English, AJ will also give you extra tools and pieces of advice regarding reading, writing, public speaking and other fields.</p>
                            <p>No doubts that you'll close this book with another opinion, other plans and strategies on how to learn English or any other language but the additional bonus, and I'm talking by experience, is that you can use the same techniques with a lot of other skills.</p>

                        <h4>CHAPTER 1 <br> A Better Way to Learn English</h4>
                        <p>...I understand if you're skeptical - particularly if you've been trying to learn English the traditional way. You've put in the hours: memorizing vocabulary lists, doing grammar drills, reading boring textbooks. “How?” you're thinking, “can speaking English possibly be effortless?”...</p>

                        <h4>CHAPTER 2 <br> The Problem with Schools</h4>
                        <p>...Schools like the grammar translation method because it appears to be serious, academic and complex. The grammar translation method fits the way schools teach most subjects — with textbooks, lectures, notes, memorization, and tests. The only problem, as you know, is that it doesn't work. In real conversations, there simply is no time to think about grammar formulas and their exceptions. The failure rate for this method, therefore, is absolutely horrible....</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 3 <br>Psychology Is More Important Than Grammar and Vocabulary</h4>
                        <p>...While schools are focused just on method, they completely ignore the first part of the Effortless English™ system — the psychology. Yet, psychology is probably the most important element for success with English speaking. When you think of your own English speaking, you'll realize that your nervousness, lack of confidence, and frustration are major problems. How do you change these?...</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 4 <br> Your Beliefs Determine Your English Success</h4>
                        <p>...The problem is that these beliefs then affected all of your English experiences that followed. So whenever you had another encounter with English, it was always with these negative limiting beliefs. Because of this, you automatically viewed every new experience with English more negatively. If your beliefs are strongly negative and you don't change them, you can completely destroy your ability to succeed as an English speaker....</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 5 <br>English Is A Physical Sport </h4>
                        <p>...Studying grammar rules to speak English is much like a soccer player studying physics to play soccer. It might be interesting (or not!), but it certainly won't help performance. Your job, therefore, is to stop “studying” English and start “playing” it!...</p>

                        <p>...Do yourself a favor: Choose big, audacious, powerful goals for learning English. Ignite your passion!...</p>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 7 <br>Program Your Brain For English Success</h4>
                        <p>...Internal movies have soundtracks, and these too can be controlled and changed. You control the loudness of the sounds in your movie. You control the rhythm. You can change the tone and pitch, making sounds higher or lower....</p>

                        <h4>CHAPTER 9 <br> The First Rule - Learn Phrases Not Words</h4>
                        <p>...In other words, you learn the language in chunks. So, instead of just writing down the word hate, you would write down John hates ice cream. You would write down the whole phrase and its meaning....</p>

                        <p>...If someone asks you a question, you have to answer it immediately. You don't have time to think about prepositions. You don't have time to think about verb tenses, possessives, phrasal verbs - all the other linguistic terms you've learned. There's no time....</p>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 11 <br> The Third Rule: Learn With Your Ears, Not With Your Eyes</h4>
                        <p>...If you listen a lot, you are going to learn vocabulary. You will learn grammar. You will get faster at speaking and you will understand what people are saying to you....</p>

                        <p>...You need to repeat each audio at least once a day for seven days. You're doing this because you want your knowledge to go deeper and deeper. You are learning for mastery....</p>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 13 <br> The Fifth Rule: Learn Grammar Intuitively And Unconsciously</h4>
                        <p>...We have discussed the benefits of point-of-view stories to your English. These are significant. However, the psychological benefits of these stories are perhaps even more powerful....</p>

                        <p>...Real pronunciation is also much different than what you'll find in textbooks and their audios. This is another source of difficulty for those who learn using traditional methods....</p>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 15 <br> The Seventh Rule: Learn English With Compelling Stories</h4>
                        <p>...And when a story is designed to be strange, funny, or highly emotional, it is even easier to remember. This is why listen-and-answer stories use strange characters and exaggerated events....</p>

                        <p>...In fact, you will no longer “study English,” you will “play English.” You will enjoy your natural curiosity. You'll use fun, interesting, compelling, real materials....</p>
                        <h4>CHAPTER 17 <br> The Power of Pleasure Reading</h4>
                        <p>...Some learners think they'll improve faster by reading difficult material but the opposite is true. The best reading materials are ones you can read without the use of a dictionary....</p>

                        <h4>CHAPTER 19 <br> Why You Should Not Practice Speaking</h4>
