                <p>Effortless English Code is a code of conduct of the EE community. It's the way we behave in our family.</p>
                <p> <span class="heading">We Do The Best We Can - </span> This means we always try to do our best. It also implies that we do not worry about making mistakes, not only in English but also in life. We try our best. We always try to be as good as we can.</p>
                <p> <span class="heading">We Do The Right Thing - </span> This means we are respectful of each other. We do not say bad things about other people, countries, or religions. We are open, and we accept other people. It also means we are honest, we don't steal, we don't lie. Do the right thing!</p>
                <p> <span class="heading">We Show Each Other We Care - </span> This means we show other members that we care about them.

                <h1>VISION</h1>
                <p>Unlike the code, mission, and values, AJ did not explicitly define Effortless English Vision. But at the very beginning of his podcast, he openly spoke about his vision for the Effortless English club, his company, and community:</p>
                <p><blockquote>"What I really want is to create an international community of learners, founded on principles of lifelong learning, autonomy, independence, hospitality, mutual encouragement, equality, and respect. I envision a community in which every member is both a learner and a teacher. I envision a community in which members help each other, encourage each other, support each other. I envision a community that offers mutual respect and hospitality to one another. I envision a community that encourages independent learning. I envision a community that supports curiosity, engagement, and passion for communication. I hope the Effortless English club will grow into a positive, enthusiastic, supportive community of learners. I hope members will help and encourage each other. I hope they will chat, trade emails, and start Skype discussion groups. I even hope they'll visit each other and offer hospitality to one another."</blockquote> </p>
