                <h1>EFFORTLESS ENGLISH PODCAST</h1>
                <p>Effortless English podcast started in 2006. The original name was - EFFORTLESS LANGUAGE ACQUISITION PODCAST. AJ used his podcast to spread the teaching ideas discussed in his <a href="http://effortlessacquisition.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"> blog </a> and as a way to promote his newly founded company. In the beginning, the main audience was English teachers and advanced English students. Don't be surprised with the very advanced level of English in the first episodes.</p>
                <p>As of this writing, AJ has done more than <span class="red">850&nbsp;podcasts&nbsp;total</span> <span class="small">(Source: Castbox)</span>. This number includes all the formats: audio podcasts, videocasts, EE video shows, interviews, book and movie clubs, walk 'n' talks, recorded VIP teleseminars. The duration varies from 3 minutes to almost 3 hours, on average around 40 minutes.</p>
                <p>From the beginning the main focus of the podcast was on language learning and languague acquisition. Also, AJ secretly recorded his conversations with family members and friends and put them in some episodes. The idea was to give his students authentic English material for listening. Over more than fifteen years EE Podcast has evolved a lot. It has changed its focus many times. It also changed the format and platforms for brodcasting.</p>
                <p>According to AJ, <span class="red">only English is boring</span> therefore he's always been trying to talk about a variety of topics from real life in his shows. In some episodes, he reflects on the events from his life such as living in his car or van, his teaching experience abroad, his childhood, his family, American culture and tradition. He also talks about goals and achieving success. Some other topics of his show include relationships, health, meditation and spiritual practice, public speaking, job searching and job interviews, career...</p>
                <p>Until 2016, AJ strongly avoided discussing politics in his shows. But irritated by the 2016 United States presidential election, he decided to speak up his mind. He started pointing on biased reporting from the media and all the censorship happening in America. Because of this, he also became the victim of censorship on the main social media. The podcast became more genuine and so much interesting topics opened up. That's when AJ started the mission of <span class="red">red-pilling</span>  us, his students.</p>
                <p>The milestone for the EE Show was 2018. That's the year AJ decided to do <span class="red">one show every day</span>. This year he started doing Book Club Shows. He also started recording audio-only podcasts named Walk n Talks, during his walking time. On some days he would publish two shows per day. The same practice continued in 2019 which is the record year for the EE Podcast.</p>

            <blockquote>"I'm looking to interview people. What kind of people do I want to interview? Interesting people, people with interesting and useful ideas.<br>It's really good for you because you get to hear different English speakers. They might use a lot of vocabulary words that I don't use. Each speaker has a little bit different style, different speed and all of this is useful for you."</blockquote> -AJ Hoge

            <blockquote>"I decided to do something different for you, audio podcast listeners. I thought I have a portable audio recorder and why not do a special show where I just talk to you while I walk around the city."</blockquote> -AJ Hoge, 2018

            <h1><i class="fas fa-shoe-prints"></i> WALK AND TALK</h1>
            <div class="walkntalk-grid">
                <p class="book">AJ started doing Walk n Talks during summer 2018. He used to walk from his apartment in the south of Osaka Japan to the downtown area. He usually did his work at a coffee shop in downtown Osaka. His walk was usually about one hour. The idea was to give his listeners one hour of free English listening almost every day.</p>
                <p class="book">Walk n Talks went viral among EE students. They liked it a lot and encouraged AJ to do more. For months they were the main format of the Effortless English podcast. AJ would publish seven audio podcasts and only one video (usually book club) each week. He continued doing Walk n Talks even after his children were born. He would carry one of the tweens or both, and he'd walk and of course talk.</p>
                <p class="book">During Walk n Talks AJ talked about a variety of topics including hiking, camping, World cup, American football, golf, diets, fitness, aging, homeschooling. He also talked about purpose, mission, money, career, entrepreneurship, leadership. You can find some podcasts where AJ discusses good vs evil, virtues vs sins, intuition vs thinking, true friends vs fake friends, youth vs elders, patriots vs traitors, food vs fasting, video games vs board games...</p>
                <p class="book">AJ went out of his way to explain U.S. measurements to us, non-Americans, especially at the beginning of doing Walk n Talks <sup>*</sup>. He also brought up some great quotes and wisdom from old books like Art of War, Henry V, Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, Tao Te Ching, and many more. Thanks to AJ we were introduced to some powerful concepts from real life such as the Red pill,  ZFG, Streisand effect, Q...</p>
                <p class="book"><sup>*</sup> Special accent was on converting temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. If you still struggle with that, here's a little help. Have fun! <br> <br>  <label for="degreeC">Enter temperature in degrees Celsius</label> <input type="number" id="degreeC" max="60" min="-90" placeholder="from -90 to +60 C"> <br> <span id="dergeeF"></span>
                </p>
                <p class="book">Above all the main charm of Walk n Talks is their authenticity. You can almost feel the atmosphere of streets, parks, and coffee shops in Osaka. AJ often ran into people who greeted him, said hi to passengers, and once even helped a woman who collapsed on the street. He promoted his city in the best possible way, describing its landmarks, history, and people,  making us want to visit it. As he jokingly said many times, I hope he'll get sponsorship from Japan Tourism Agency. It'd be well deserved.</p>
